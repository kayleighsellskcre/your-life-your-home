# How to Use the Multi-Property System

## Adding Your First Property

When you first access the Equity Overview page after the update, the system automatically creates a default property called "My Home" with any existing data you had. You don't need to do anything!

## Adding Additional Properties

1. **Navigate to Equity Overview**
   - Go to the "Value" section and click "Equity Overview"

2. **Click "Add Another Home"**
   - You'll see a button in the top-right corner with a house icon
   - Click it to open the property form

3. **Fill Out the Form**
   - **Property Address** (Required): Enter the full address
     - Example: "123 Main St, Springfield, IL"
   - **Estimated Value** (Optional): Enter the current value
     - Example: "450000" or "450,000"
   - **Property Type**: Select from dropdown
     - Primary Residence (default)
     - Investment Property
     - Vacation Home
     - Rental Property

4. **Submit**
   - Click "Add Property" button
   - The page will reload showing your new property
   - You'll see a success message confirming it was added

## Switching Between Properties

Once you have 2 or more properties, a dropdown selector will appear below the page header.

**To Switch Properties**:
1. Click the dropdown that shows your current property
2. Select a different property from the list
3. The page automatically reloads with that property's data

**What You'll See in the Dropdown**:
- Property address
- Estimated value (if entered)
- "(Primary)" badge on your primary property

## Managing Loan Details for Each Property

Each property has its own separate loan information:

1. **Select the Property** you want to update (using the dropdown)

2. **Scroll to "Your Loan Information" Section**

3. **Enter Details**:
   - Current Home Value
   - Loan Balance
   - Interest Rate (%)
   - Monthly Payment
   - Loan Term (years)
   - Loan Start Date

4. **Click "Update Loan Details"**

5. **View Results**: All calculations update automatically:
   - Current equity
   - LTV ratio
   - Payoff timeline
   - Refinance scenarios
   - Mortgage optimizer calculator

**Important**: Loan details are saved separately for each property. When you switch properties, you'll see that property's specific data.

## Understanding Property Status

### Primary Property
- The property marked as "Primary" is your main/default property
- When you add a new property, it automatically becomes primary
- When you switch properties, the selected one becomes primary
- This helps the system remember which property to show by default

### Property Types
- **Primary Residence**: Your main home where you live
- **Investment Property**: Property purchased for investment/income
- **Vacation Home**: Second home for personal use
- **Rental Property**: Property rented to tenants

## Using the Mortgage Optimizer

The Mortgage Optimizer Calculator works independently for each property:

1. **Enter loan details** for the current property (see above)
2. **Scroll to "Mortgage Optimizer Calculator"**
3. **Move the slider** to see savings from extra monthly payments
4. **View Results**:
   - Interest saved over loan life
   - Years/months saved on payoff
   - New payoff date
   - Comparison message

**Note**: The calculator will only work after you've entered complete loan information for that property.

## Tips for Multiple Properties

### Best Practices
1. **Use clear addresses**: Include city/state to distinguish properties
2. **Update values regularly**: Keep estimated values current for accurate equity tracking
3. **Set accurate loan details**: Complete information gives better insights
4. **Use property types**: Helps organize and identify properties quickly

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Primary Home + Rental Property**
- Add your primary residence first
- Add rental property with "Rental Property" type
- Track equity separately for each
- Compare appreciation rates between properties

**Scenario 2: Selling and Buying**
- Keep old property until sale is complete
- Add new property when purchasing
- Both properties track separately
- You can delete old property later (future feature)

**Scenario 3: Vacation Home**
- Add vacation home with "Vacation Home" type
- Track its equity independent of primary home
- See if it's appreciating as expected
- Use what-if scenarios for potential rental income

## What Happens When You Switch Properties?

When you select a different property from the dropdown:
- ✅ Page reloads with new property's data
- ✅ Loan information shows that property's details
- ✅ Equity calculations are property-specific
- ✅ Mortgage optimizer uses that property's loan
- ✅ What-if scenarios calculate for that property
- ✅ Selected property becomes your primary property

**Your other properties' data is NOT affected** - each property maintains its own separate information.

## Troubleshooting

### "Property selector doesn't appear"
- The selector only shows when you have 2+ properties
- If you only have one property, it displays automatically

### "Calculator not working"
- Make sure you've entered ALL loan details for the current property
- Check that values are numeric (no special characters except comma)
- Verify the property you're viewing has loan data saved

### "Wrong data showing"
- Check which property is selected in the dropdown
- Make sure you submitted the loan form after entering data
- Look for success message confirming the update

### "Lost my data"
- Each property stores data independently
- Switch back to the correct property using the dropdown
- Data is saved per property, not globally

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check which property is currently selected
2. Verify you've saved loan details for that specific property
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check for error messages (red alerts)
5. Contact support if problems persist

**Remember**: Each property is completely independent. When you add or update information, it only affects the currently selected property!
