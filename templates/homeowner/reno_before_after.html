    <ul style="font-size: 0.95rem; margin: 1rem 0 0 1.5rem; padding: 0; line-height: 1.8;">
      <li>Upload before and after photos for each project</li>
      <li>Add short notes about what changed and how it felt</li>
      <li>Connect each change to your Renovation planner entries</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="card-subtext" style="margin-top: 1rem;">For now you can keep photos organized in your own folders and use the planner to name and track the projects themselves.</p>
